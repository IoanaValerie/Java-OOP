# Java-OOP
Implemented an online school register with multiple options: teachers can add grades, students can check their courses grades and parents receive notifications when a grade is added, using Java language and design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, Observer, Builder, Memento and Visitor.
For the graphical interface I used Java Swing elements such as: JButton, JList, JPanel, JScrollPane, JTextField.
There are also 2 test classes in which I parsed the JSon file:
  - the Test class that tests the addition of all notes in the catalog, displays the catalog, but also adds a new group with its notes in a course from the catalog (the first) to test the functionality of the Memento Design Pattern;
  - the TestInterface class that tests the functionality of the graphical interface for a student assigned to a course in the catalog (the first);
